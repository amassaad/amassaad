### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - An [app to save podcasts](https://github.com/amassaad/podcast_vault) and their metadata (and soon, media too): 
  - Using [Ruby and the OpenAI API](https://github.com/amassaad/honey-ai-shrunk-the-kids) to summarize text automatically: 
  - A project to print GitHub Issues to paper using a receipt printer. This is to avoid switching tabs when coding.

  - Kubernetes by building and managing my own [microk8s cluster](https://github.com/amassaad/k8s)
  - [Chat GPT and the OpenAI API](https://github.com/amassaad/honey-ai-shrunk-the-kids)
